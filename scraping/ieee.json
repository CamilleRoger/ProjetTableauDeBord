    "resume": "In order to improve the accuracy of electricity consumption forecasting in smart grid, a novel penalized weighted kernel partial least squares algorithm is presented. The original inputs are mapped into a high dimensional feature space to realize the linearization of nonlinear problems. The partial least squares algorithm is used to extract the principal component to reduce the dimensional of data. According to the local learning theory, a weighted least squares regression model is constructed based on the new data set formed by the principal component. The model sensitivity of abnormal data is reduced and the model parameters are optimized.The data from industrial electricity consumption of Jiangsu province in 2008 are used for validation and the results show that WK-PLS has higher accuracy than PLS in electricity load prediction.",

    "resume": "Electric Vehicles (EVs) have the potential to provide numerous ancillary services to the grid owing to the fact that they can act as either loads or sources when connected to the grid. However, customers are still disinclined to embrace this technology because of long battery charging time, limited range, and high battery replacement costs. Widespread rollout of fast Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS), however, could solve these shortcomings as they make services readily available for them and work as the stimulus for the future growth. Seemingly, reliability of those services by EVCS depends upon the optimum design of it, since over-dimensioning may render it as uneconomical or conversely, technically unreliable for the case of under-dimensioning. In this paper, an algorithm is developed for optimum sizing of Photovoltaic (PV) panel, Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) and Grid Transformer for an EVCS circumscribed by the grid constraints.",

Combining PV systems with EV charging station can contribute to more benefit, according to previous research, but also lead to some problem. In order to solve the problem of energy management and profit distribution, a multi-party energy management for EV charging station cooperated with PV systems in smart grid is proposed. Firstly, the feasible model of EV charging energy demand is established based on starting charging time, departure time and SOC, which is varied with the PV power. The actual charging power can be then decided according to the relationship between charging demand and PV power. Finally, the operation profit is distributed to each project using Shapley value method, which considers the contribution of each project. A comprehensive result obtained from simulation tests has shown that the proposed energy management can obviously increase the profit of each party in cooperation mode compared to independent mode, which can be utilized to practical application.",

    "resume": "The share of decentralized power generation is increasing, which causes general changes and challenges for the conventional power system. Hence, distribution system operators (DSO) need new technologies to ensure the stability of the entire electrical power system. As a feasible solution for structuring power networks, the Clustering Power System Approach (CPSA) has been introduced, providing an innovative and reasonable way of decentralisation for future-oriented power systems. With this approach, based on the Cluster Fractal Model, the stabilization of the power systems can be realized in a bottom-up direction from decentralized generation units in distribution grids to the upstream transmission grids. However, to accomplish smart operations in such decentralized and intelligent electricity networks an appropriate strategy for the interoperation between cluster areas is needed. To realize this concept this paper proposes a real-time orchestration system as a core functionality of Smart Grid Cluster Controllers (SGCC) to run the distribution control and management functions. Hereby, the characteristic needs of such functions inside or between clusters can be taken into account. Structural or hierarchical dependencies of the functions can also be considered. Lastly, the SGCC is implemented on different hardware platforms.",

A classical example of flexible load that can be exploited for DR and DSM purposes is the electric heat pump. This paper aims at evaluating the main factors affecting the flexibility available in the management of electric heat pumps for space heating. The performed analysis allows identifying some indexes to quantify the available flexibility and highlights how the thermal comfort requirements of the customers affect the provided level of flexibility. Sample simulations show the impact of these flexibility terms on the results of a DSM program designed for power peak shaving at grid level. The possible use of the defined indexes for sorting the customers flexibility and for estimating the potential benefits offered by the adopted DSM scheme is also investigated and discussed.",

However, the high cost and low accessibility of current power grid monitoring systems restrict their large-scale deployment over highly distributed microgrids. In this paper, we present a practical frequency and phase angle monitoring system design over mobile platforms, which significantly reduces the cost of power grid monitoring by utilizing the functionalities of modern mobile devices. We harvest the 200 Hz Primary Synchronization Signal (PSS) embedded in the 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) cellular signal for time synchronization in power grid monitoring, replacing the Pulse-Per-Second (PPS) signal that is retrieved from GPS receivers and being used by current monitoring systems. We implement our system over realistic smartphones with a few peripheral hardware, and realize a frequency monitoring accuracy of 0.2 mHz and a phase angle monitoring accuracy of 0.01 rad. Experiment results compared with the traditional Frequency Disturbance Recorders (FDRs) verify the effectiveness of our proposed system.",

    "date": "09 May 2017 ",
    "type": "publication",
    "nb-vues": 185,
    "resume": "Variable selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant variables for use in model construction. It is a critical step in forecasting but has not yet played a major role in the load forecasting literature. In probabilistic load forecasting, many methodologies to date rely on the variable selection mechanisms inherited from the point load forecasting literature. Consequently, the variables of an underlying model for probabilistic load forecasting are selected by minimizing a point error measure. On the other hand, a holistic and seemingly more accurate method would be to select variables using probabilistic error measures. Nevertheless, this holistic approach by nature requires more computational efforts than its counterpart. As the computing technologies are being greatly enhanced over time, a fundamental research question arises: can we significantly improve the forecast skill by taking the holistic yet computationally intensive variable selection method? This paper tackles the variable selection problem in probabilistic load forecasting by proposing a holistic method (HoM) and comparing it with a heuristic method (HeM). HoM uses a probabilistic error measure to select the variables to construct the underlying model for probabilistic forecasting, which is consistent with the error measure used for the final probabilistic forecast evaluation. HeM takes a shortcut by relying on a point error measure for variable selection. The evidence from the empirical study covering seven states of the United States suggests that 1) the two methods indeed return different variable sets for the underlying models, and 2) HoM slightly outperforms but does not dominate HeM w.r.t. the skill of probabilistic load forecasts. Nevertheless, the conclusion might vary on other datasets. Other empirical studies of the same nature would be encouraged as part of the future work.",

    "resume": "Successful development of smart grid demands strengthened system security and reliability, which requires effective security analysis in conducting system operation and expansion planning. Classical N - 1 criterion has been widely used to examine every creditable contingency through detailed computations in the past. The adequacy of such approach becomes doubtful in many recent blackouts where cascading outages are usually involved. This may be attributed to the increased complexities and nonlinearities involved in operating conditions and network structures in context of smart grid development. To address security threats, particularly from cascading outages, a new and efficient security analysis approach is proposed, which comprises cascading failure simulation module (CFSM) for post-contingency analysis and risk evaluation module (REM) based on a decorrelated neural network ensembles (DNNE) algorithm. This approach overcomes the drawbacks of high computational cost in classical N-k-induced cascading contingency analysis. Case studies on two different IEEE test systems and a practical transmission system-Polish 2383-bus system have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for risk evaluation of cascading contingency.",
